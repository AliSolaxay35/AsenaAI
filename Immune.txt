- Columns: Age, White Blood Cell Count, Antibody Level, Diagnosis (0 = Healthy, 1 = Sick)

ðŸ”¹ Workflow:
1. Load The Dataset Using Pandas.
2. Split The Data Into Training And Testing Sets.
3. Train A Decision Tree Classifier (Using Scikit-Learn).
4. Evaluate The Accuracy Of The Model.
5. Make A Prediction On A New Sample (Example Provided In Code).

ðŸ“Œ This Version Uses A Fixed File Path And A Hardcoded Sample. For A More Interactive Version With User Input And Logging, See "ImmuneV1.1.py".

Requirements:
- Python 3.10+
