This Python Script Implements A Simple Immunology Disease Prediction Model Using Decision Tree Classifier.  

It Loads The Dataset From A CSV File And Splits It Into Training And Testing Sets.  
The Model Is Trained And Evaluated For Accuracy.  

The Script Then Asks The User To Enter Patient Information Including Name, Age, White Blood Cell Count, And Antibody Level.  
Based On The Input, It Predicts Whether The Patient Is Sick (1) Or Healthy (0).  

All Predictions Along With Patient Information And Timestamp Are Saved To A CSV Log File Named "prediction_log.csv" For Future Reference.  

Make Sure To Have The Dataset CSV File And Proper Write Permissions For Saving The Log File.

Thank You.
