model.py Explanation:

This Python Script Uses The Classic Iris Flower Dataset To Build A Simple Machine Learning Model With Scikit-Learn.

Steps In The Script:

1. Load The Iris Dataset, Which Contains Measurements Of Iris Flowers And Their Species Labels.
2. Split The Data Into Training And Testing Sets(80% Train, 20% Test).
3. Train A Decision Tree Classifier On The Training Data.
4. Evaluate The Model's Accuracy On The Test Data And Print The Result.
5. Predict The Class Of A New Flower Sample With Specific Feature Values.
6. Print The Predicted Class Number And Its Corresponding Flower Species Name.

This Example Demonstrates Basic Classification, Model Training, Evaluation, And Prediction Using Scikit-Learn.

Thank You.
