Iris.py Explanation

This Python Script Trains A Simple Machine Learning Model Using The Famous Iris Flower Dataset From Scikit-Learn.

Main Steps:

1. Load The Iris Dataset (Includes Sepal And Petal Measurements For 3 Iris Species).
2. Split The Dataset Into Training And Testing Sets (80% Training, 20% Testing).
3. Use A Decision Tree Classifier To Train The Model On The Training Data.
4. Evaluate The Model Accuracy Using The Test Set And Display The Result.
5. Ask The User To Input Four Measurements Of A Flower:
   - Sepal Length
   - Sepal Width
   - Petal Length
   - Petal Width
6. Predict The Species Based On The User's Input.
7. Display The Predicted Class Number And Class Name (Setosa, Versicolor, Or Virginica).

This Is A Beginner-Friendly Example To Understand Supervised Classification And User Input Integration In A Machine Learning Workflow.
